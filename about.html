  hi my name is Harley ive been a junior Developer since the start of 2020 and have been loving my journey, before this i completed a cert III in electrotechnology and worked as a Stone Mason but found that my real passion was in learning programming! Although im still a beginner im always ready for a new challenge and am willing to up the time and effort needed in order to make my dreams become reality.In the future i hope to be someone that can share my skills and knowledge to others and become a key part to whoever im working for.
