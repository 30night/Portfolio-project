<h1>Purpose</h1>

the main purpose of my website is to practice the skills i have learnt over the past week and to make a website that includes an array of techniques in css and html each page i tried to diversify using a different technique of html and css. i also was a bit disappointed in how simple my ruby app was and really wanted to push myself in the coding aspect of this website and test my limits to see where i stand in my understanding time management and understanding of code i don't this will be my permanent website as there are definitely things i can improve on but i have learnt many valuable lessons while making this and will definitely remember the good and the bad of my first website.

<h1>Functionality and Features</h1>

<h2>navigation bar</h2>
this site includes a simple navigation bar at the bottom of the page that is fixed i coloured it black so it would be the main focal point of the site so if this were to be seen by people they would easily find the bar allowing them to find what they are looking for. I am happy with the functionality of the bar but would eventually like to add a hover feature.

<h2>Main page</h2>
the front page took a majority of my time as like i said in the purpose i wanted to push myself and one of the main ways i did that was to implement some java script to my front page this took me awhile to do but i was very pleased with the result.

<h2>Diversity</h2>
each page of my website i tried to set up in a completely different way to each other practicing my flex-box skills and flex grid and seeing what areas are my strengths and what areas i needed working on i was definitely most satisfied with the main page but also like the flex cards which was implemented in the "skills" page.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
in the end my website was not filly optimized for smaller screens but as the skills page looks dreadful i did try to use media queries as much as i could but in the end could not implement all the optimization i wanted.

<h1>Style</h1>
My style was very basic, this was by choice as i felt as though if i added images it would take away from the goal of my website and that was to showcase my programming skills. i wanted the focus of my website to be about the code, i was inspired by a alternate version of the Miami Heat jersey that is included in my pintrest page <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/haroscmil2011/web-ideas/" >here</a> i really liked the contrast of colours and the simpleness of my website my other options were to have a simple black and white or red and white web page but felt as though that wouldn't show off as much knowledge in css.

<h1>integrity</h1>
my website included sha384 security in order to avoid files being tampered with and potentially receiving malicious code by third party systems

<h1>Target audience</h1>
The main target audience for this webpage will be mainly employers as it will showcase what i know i do not plan to keep this as my permanent website but will definitely keep it the way is is as i would like to keep it as something i can look back on and see the progress i have made 

<h1>Improvements and thoughts</h1>
in the end i was satisfied with the code i put in but definitely think i could have done more with the given time but halfway through i didn't like where the site was going a completely revamped also i believe that my time management skills and allocation of time to particular projects could be improved. Although starting again put me back i think in the end it was for the best. some things i would change next time i make a website is to split up my scc files more for easier readability when coding and assigning more classes i also think i could improve the design a lot as now that i see what my website looks like with flat colours it seems rough around the edges.
